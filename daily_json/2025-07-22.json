        "title": "TokensGen: Harnessing Condensed Tokens for Long Video Generation",
        "summary": "Generating consistent long videos is a complex challenge: while\ndiffusion-based generative models generate visually impressive short clips,\nextending them to longer durations often leads to memory bottlenecks and\nlong-term inconsistency. In this paper, we propose TokensGen, a novel two-stage\nframework that leverages condensed tokens to address these issues. Our method\ndecomposes long video generation into three core tasks: (1) inner-clip semantic\ncontrol, (2) long-term consistency control, and (3) inter-clip smooth\ntransition. First, we train To2V (Token-to-Video), a short video diffusion\nmodel guided by text and video tokens, with a Video Tokenizer that condenses\nshort clips into semantically rich tokens. Second, we introduce T2To\n(Text-to-Token), a video token diffusion transformer that generates all tokens\nat once, ensuring global consistency across clips. Finally, during inference,\nan adaptive FIFO-Diffusion strategy seamlessly connects adjacent clips,\nreducing boundary artifacts and enhancing smooth transitions. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances long-term temporal\nand content coherence without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. By\nleveraging condensed tokens and pre-trained short video models, our method\nprovides a scalable, modular solution for long video generation, opening new\npossibilities for storytelling, cinematic production, and immersive\nsimulations.
