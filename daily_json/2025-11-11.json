        "summary": "Remarkable advances in recent 2D image and 3D shape generation have induced a\nsignificant focus on dynamic 4D content generation. However, previous 4D\ngeneration methods commonly struggle to maintain spatial-temporal consistency\nand adapt poorly to rapid temporal variations, due to the lack of effective\nspatial-temporal modeling. To address these problems, we propose a novel 4D\ngeneration network called 4DSTR, which modulates generative 4D Gaussian\nSplatting with spatial-temporal rectification. Specifically, temporal\ncorrelation across generated 4D sequences is designed to rectify deformable\nscales and rotations and guarantee temporal consistency. Furthermore, an\nadaptive spatial densification and pruning strategy is proposed to address\nsignificant temporal variations by dynamically adding or deleting Gaussian\npoints with the awareness of their pre-frame movements. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our 4DSTR achieves state-of-the-art performance in video-to-4D\ngeneration, excelling in reconstruction quality, spatial-temporal consistency,\nand adaptation to rapid temporal movements.",
