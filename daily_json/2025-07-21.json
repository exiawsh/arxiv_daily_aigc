        "title": "Light Future: Multimodal Action Frame Prediction via InstructPix2Pix",
        "summary": "Predicting future motion trajectories is a critical capability across domains\nsuch as robotics, autonomous systems, and human activity forecasting, enabling\nsafer and more intelligent decision-making. This paper proposes a novel,\nefficient, and lightweight approach for robot action prediction, offering\nsignificantly reduced computational cost and inference latency compared to\nconventional video prediction models. Importantly, it pioneers the adaptation\nof the InstructPix2Pix model for forecasting future visual frames in robotic\ntasks, extending its utility beyond static image editing. We implement a deep\nlearning-based visual prediction framework that forecasts what a robot will\nobserve 100 frames (10 seconds) into the future, given a current image and a\ntextual instruction. We repurpose and fine-tune the InstructPix2Pix model to\naccept both visual and textual inputs, enabling multimodal future frame\nprediction. Experiments on the RoboTWin dataset (generated based on real-world\nscenarios) demonstrate that our method achieves superior SSIM and PSNR compared\nto state-of-the-art baselines in robot action prediction tasks. Unlike\nconventional video prediction models that require multiple input frames, heavy\ncomputation, and slow inference latency, our approach only needs a single image\nand a text prompt as input. This lightweight design enables faster inference,\nreduced GPU demands, and flexible multimodal control, particularly valuable for\napplications like robotics and sports motion trajectory analytics, where motion\ntrajectory precision is prioritized over visual fidelity.",
